[![Deploy on Render](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deployed%20on-Render-46A2F1?logo=render)](https://neuro-sentiment-ai.onrender.com)

> Decode emotions with the power of AI — a Flask-based web app for real-time sentiment analysis.

## 🌐 Live App

🔗 **[neuro-sentiment-ai.onrender.com](https://neuro-sentiment-ai.onrender.com)**

---

## 📌 Overview

**Neuro Sentiment AI** is a lightweight web application that uses NLTK’s VADER sentiment analyzer to classify text as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. It’s built with Python, Flask, and Bootstrap, and is deployed seamlessly on [Render](https://render.com/).

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 AI-powered sentiment analysis using NLTK VADER
- ⚡ Real-time classification of text input
- 📱 Responsive UI with Bootstrap 4
- ☁️ Deployed and hosted via Render
- 💡 Clean feedback UI based on sentiment score

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters a sentence.
2. Sentence is sent to the backend via Flask.
3. VADER returns a **compound sentiment score** ranging from -1 to 1.
4. Sentiment is classified as:
   - `compound > 0` → **Positive**
   - `compound < 0` → **Negative**
   - `compound == 0` → **Neutral**
